## 📊 **Risk Metrics Fundamentals**

### **Sharpe Ratio**
**What it measures**: Risk-adjusted return - how much extra return you get for the extra risk you take.

**Formula**: `(Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility`

**Interpretation**:
- **> 1.0**: Excellent performance
- **0.5-1.0**: Good performance  
- **< 0.5**: Poor risk-adjusted performance
- **Negative**: You're losing money relative to risk-free assets

**Why it matters**: Tells you if higher returns justify the risk. A strategy with 20% return but 40% volatility (Sharpe = 0.45) might be worse than 10% return with 15% volatility (Sharpe = 0.53).

**Real Example**: 
- Strategy A: 15% return, 20% volatility → Sharpe = 0.65
- Strategy B: 25% return, 45% volatility → Sharpe = 0.51
- Strategy A is better risk-adjusted!

### **Sortino Ratio**
**What it measures**: Like Sharpe ratio, but only penalizes *downside* volatility.

**Why it's better**: Normal volatility includes both ups and downs. Sortino only cares about the downs - because investors don't mind upward price swings!

**When to use**: When your returns are asymmetric (more likely to have big gains than big losses, or vice versa).

**Interpretation**: Same as Sharpe, but typically higher values since it ignores "good" volatility.

### **Maximum Drawdown**
**What it measures**: The biggest peak-to-trough loss in your portfolio value.

**Why it's crucial**: 
- Shows the worst-case scenario you experienced
- Helps with position sizing (never risk more than you can afford to lose)
- Indicates psychological stress levels

**Example**: Portfolio goes from $100K → $130K → $80K → $150K
- Maximum Drawdown = (130K - 80K) / 130K = **38.5%**

**Practical Impact**: If you can't stomach a 40% loss, don't use strategies with 40%+ max drawdowns!

### **Calmar Ratio**
**What it measures**: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown.

**Why it's useful**: Balances return generation with downside protection.

**Interpretation**: Higher is better. Shows return per unit of worst-case risk.

### **Information Ratio**
**What it measures**: Consistency of outperformance relative to a benchmark.

**Formula**: `(Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return) / Tracking Error`

**Why it matters**: Shows if you can consistently beat the market, not just get lucky once.

### **Beta & Alpha**
**Beta**: How much your portfolio moves relative to the market
- **Beta = 1**: Moves with the market
- **Beta > 1**: More volatile than market
- **Beta < 1**: Less volatile than market

**Alpha**: Excess return after adjusting for market risk
- **Positive Alpha**: You're beating the market after risk adjustment
- **Negative Alpha**: You're underperforming

## 📉 **Value-at-Risk (VaR) Concepts**

### **What is VaR?**
**Simple Definition**: "There's a 95% chance I won't lose more than $X tomorrow."

**Technical Definition**: The maximum expected loss over a specific time period at a given confidence level.

### **Why VaR Matters**
1. **Risk Budgeting**: How much risk can you afford?
2. **Position Sizing**: How big should each trade be?
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Banks must calculate VaR
4. **Communication**: Easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders

### **VaR Methods We Implemented**

#### **1. Historical Simulation VaR**
**How it works**: Look at past returns, find the 5th percentile (for 95% VaR).

**Pros**: 
- No assumptions about return distribution
- Captures real market behavior

**Cons**: 
- Assumes future will be like the past
- Vulnerable to regime changes

**Best for**: Stable market periods, large datasets

#### **2. Parametric VaR**
**How it works**: Assume returns follow a normal distribution, use statistical formulas.

**Pros**: 
- Fast to calculate
- Smooth estimates
- Easy to understand

**Cons**: 
- Markets aren't actually normal
- Underestimates tail risks

**Best for**: Quick estimates, stable assets

#### **3. Monte Carlo VaR**
**How it works**: Simulate thousands of possible future scenarios, find the 5th percentile.

**Pros**: 
- Can model complex scenarios
- Flexible assumptions
- Captures non-linear relationships

**Cons**: 
- Computationally intensive
- Results depend on model assumptions

**Best for**: Complex portfolios, option strategies

#### **4. Cornish-Fisher VaR**
**How it works**: Adjusts normal VaR for skewness and kurtosis (fat tails).

**Pros**: 
- Accounts for non-normal distributions
- Better than pure parametric

**Cons**: 
- Still relies on statistical assumptions
- Complex to implement

**Best for**: Assets with known skewness patterns

### **Expected Shortfall (CVaR)**
**What it measures**: Average loss in the worst 5% of cases.

**Why it's better than VaR**: 
- VaR tells you the threshold
- CVaR tells you how bad it gets beyond that threshold

**Example**: 
- VaR 95% = $10,000 loss
- CVaR 95% = $15,000 loss
- Meaning: 95% of the time you won't lose more than $10K, but when you do, expect around $15K loss on average.

## 🎯 **Portfolio Theory Principles**

### **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**
**Core Insight**: You can reduce risk through diversification without reducing expected returns.

**Key Concepts**:

#### **Efficient Frontier**
**What it is**: The set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for each level of risk.

**Visual**: Imagine a curve where:
- X-axis = Risk (volatility)
- Y-axis = Expected Return
- The curve shows the best possible combinations

**Practical Use**: Any portfolio below the frontier is suboptimal - you could get better returns for the same risk.

#### **Diversification**
**The Math**: Portfolio risk < Sum of individual risks (when assets aren't perfectly correlated)

**Why it works**: 
- When one asset goes down, others might go up
- Reduces overall portfolio volatility
- "Don't put all eggs in one basket" - mathematically proven!

**Correlation Impact**:
- **Correlation = 1**: No diversification benefit
- **Correlation = 0**: Some diversification benefit  
- **Correlation = -1**: Maximum diversification benefit

#### **Risk-Return Trade-off**
**Fundamental Principle**: To get higher expected returns, you must accept higher risk.

**But**: MPT shows you can optimize this trade-off through smart portfolio construction.

### **Optimization Objectives**

#### **Maximum Sharpe Ratio**
**Goal**: Find the portfolio with the best risk-adjusted returns.
**When to use**: When you want optimal risk-adjusted performance.

#### **Minimum Volatility**
**Goal**: Lowest possible risk portfolio.
**When to use**: Conservative investors, bear markets, capital preservation.

#### **Maximum Return**
**Goal**: Highest possible expected returns.
**When to use**: Risk-tolerant investors, bull markets (but usually not recommended alone).

## 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation**

### **What is Monte Carlo?**
**Simple Explanation**: Run thousands of "what-if" scenarios to understand possible outcomes.

**How it works**:
1. Model how asset prices move (usually random walks)
2. Run the simulation thousands of times
3. Analyze the distribution of outcomes

### **Types We Implemented**

#### **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
**What it models**: Smooth, continuous price movements with random shocks.

**Formula**: `dS/S = μdt + σdW`
- **μ (mu)**: Drift (expected return trend)
- **σ (sigma)**: Volatility (randomness)
- **dW**: Random shock

**Best for**: Modeling stock prices, currencies

#### **Jump Diffusion (Merton Model)**
**What it adds**: Sudden jumps on top of smooth movements.

**Why it's better**: Markets don't just move smoothly - sometimes there are sudden shocks (news, crashes, etc.).

**Best for**: Assets prone to sudden moves (individual stocks, crypto)

### **Applications**

#### **Portfolio Simulation**
**Purpose**: See how your portfolio might perform over time.

**What you get**:
- Distribution of possible final values
- Probability of different outcomes
- Risk metrics (VaR, CVaR)

#### **Option Pricing**
**Purpose**: Value complex derivatives using simulation.

**Advantage**: Can handle exotic options that don't have closed-form solutions.

#### **Scenario Analysis**
**Purpose**: Test "what-if" scenarios.

**Examples**:
- What if correlations break down?
- What if volatility doubles?
- What if there's a market crash?

## ⚠️ **Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis**

### **Why Stress Testing?**
**Reality Check**: Normal models assume "normal" markets. But markets can be abnormal!

**Goal**: Understand how your portfolio behaves in extreme conditions.

### **Types of Stress Tests**

#### **Historical Scenarios**
**Method**: Apply historical market shocks to current portfolio.

**Examples**:
- 2008 Financial Crisis
- 1987 Black Monday
- COVID-19 crash

**Pros**: Based on real events
**Cons**: Past events might not repeat

#### **Hypothetical Scenarios**
**Method**: Create "what-if" scenarios based on current concerns.

**Examples**:
- 30% stock market crash
- Interest rate spike
- Currency devaluation

**Pros**: Can test current concerns
**Cons**: Might miss unexpected risks

#### **Monte Carlo Stress Testing**
**Method**: Simulate extreme scenarios using statistical models.

**Approach**: Increase volatility, add correlation breakdown, simulate tail events.

### **Stress Testing Results Interpretation**

**Key Questions**:
1. How much would I lose in the worst-case scenario?
2. How long would it take to recover?
3. Would I be forced to liquidate positions?
4. Can I psychologically handle these losses?

---

## 🔧 **Practical Applications**

### **For Position Sizing**
```
If VaR(95%) = $5,000 per day
And you can afford to lose $10,000 per day
Then you can double your position size
```

### **For Strategy Selection**
```
Strategy A: Sharpe = 1.2, Max DD = 15%
Strategy B: Sharpe = 0.8, Max DD = 8%

Choose A if you can handle volatility
Choose B if you need stability
```

### **For Risk Management**
```
Set stop-losses at 2x daily VaR
Reduce positions when correlation increases
Increase cash when stress tests show high losses
```

### **For Portfolio Construction**
```
Use MPT to find optimal weights
Stress test the optimal portfolio
Adjust based on your risk tolerance
Monitor and rebalance regularly
```
