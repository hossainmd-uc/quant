# Python for Finance Book Knowledge Extraction Guide

## 🚀 Overview

This guide shows you how to use the [LandingAI agentic-doc API](https://github.com/landing-ai/agentic-doc) to extract structured knowledge from your "Python for Finance" book and integrate it into our advanced quantitative trading system.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install agentic-doc
# or install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get LandingAI API Key

1. Visit [https://landing.ai/agentic-document-extraction](https://landing.ai/agentic-document-extraction)
2. Sign up and get your API key
3. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export LANDINGAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:
```bash
LANDINGAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Verify Book File

Make sure your book file is in the project root:
```
quant/
├── Python for Finance Mastering Data-Driven Finance (Yves Hilpisch) (Z-Library).pdf
├── core/
├── research/
└── ...
```

## 📖 Extraction Process

### Run the Extraction Script

```bash
cd /home/nerdystorm/quant
python research/extract_book_knowledge.py
```

### What the Script Does

1. **Document Parsing**: Uses agentic-doc to extract structured content from the PDF
2. **Content Analysis**: Categorizes concepts by financial domain (risk management, options, ML, etc.)
3. **Code Extraction**: Finds Python code snippets and examples
4. **Formula Extraction**: Identifies mathematical formulas and equations
5. **Knowledge Structuring**: Organizes everything into searchable categories
6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis reports

## 📊 Expected Output

The extraction will create an `extracted_knowledge/` directory with:

```
extracted_knowledge/
├── knowledge.json           # Complete extracted knowledge
├── knowledge.pkl           # Python pickle format
├── concepts.csv            # Concepts as CSV
├── extraction_report.json  # Analysis report
├── groundings/            # Visual groundings from extraction
└── visualizations/        # Parsed document visualizations
```

### Sample Extraction Results

Based on the agentic-doc capabilities, you can expect to extract:

- **500-1000+ concepts** from the book
- **100+ code snippets** with Python examples
- **50+ mathematical formulas** and equations
- **Categorized content** by financial domains:
  - Risk Management
  - Options & Derivatives
  - Portfolio Theory
  - Time Series Analysis
  - Machine Learning
  - Trading Strategies
  - Data Analysis

## 🔍 Using Extracted Knowledge

### 1. Search for Specific Concepts

```python
from core.data.document_extractor import DocumentExtractor
import pickle

# Load extracted knowledge
with open('extracted_knowledge/knowledge.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    knowledge = pickle.load(f)

extractor = DocumentExtractor()

# Search for risk management concepts
risk_concepts = extractor.search_knowledge(knowledge, "risk management")
print(f"Found {len(risk_concepts)} risk management concepts")

# Search by category
ml_concepts = extractor.search_knowledge(knowledge, "machine learning", "machine_learning")
```

### 2. Integrate into Trading Strategies

```python
# Example: Extract Black-Scholes implementation
bs_concepts = extractor.search_knowledge(knowledge, "black-scholes")
for concept in bs_concepts:
    print(f"Title: {concept.title}")
    print(f"Code examples: {concept.code_examples}")
    print(f"Formulas: {concept.formulas}")
```

### 3. Enhance Feature Engineering

Use extracted concepts to improve your feature engineering:

```python
from core.data.features import FeatureEngineer

# Get volatility calculation methods from book
vol_concepts = extractor.search_knowledge(knowledge, "volatility")

# Implement new features based on book insights
feature_engineer = FeatureEngineer()
# Add new features based on extracted knowledge
```

## 🎯 Integration Opportunities

### Risk Management Enhancements
- **VaR Calculations**: Extract advanced VaR methodologies
- **Stress Testing**: Implement scenario analysis techniques
- **Risk Metrics**: Add new risk measurement approaches

### Trading Strategy Development
- **Signal Generation**: Use book's signal processing techniques
- **Backtesting**: Implement advanced backtesting methods
- **Execution**: Optimize order execution strategies

### Machine Learning Models
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply book's feature selection methods
- **Model Architectures**: Implement specialized financial ML models
- **Ensemble Methods**: Use advanced model combination techniques

### Portfolio Optimization
- **Markowitz Theory**: Implement modern portfolio theory
- **Risk Parity**: Add risk parity optimization
- **Factor Models**: Build multi-factor models

## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Custom Extraction

For more control over the extraction process:

```python
from core.data.document_extractor import DocumentExtractor

extractor = DocumentExtractor("your_api_key")

# Custom extraction with specific settings
knowledge = extractor.extract_from_pdf(
    pdf_path="your_book.pdf",
    output_dir="custom_output"
)

# Search for specific patterns
options_concepts = extractor.search_knowledge(
    knowledge, 
    "options", 
    category="options"
)
```

### Batch Processing

If you have multiple finance books:

```python
books = [
    "Python for Finance.pdf",
    "Quantitative Trading.pdf",
    "Machine Learning for Finance.pdf"
]

all_knowledge = []
for book in books:
    knowledge = extractor.extract_from_pdf(book)
    all_knowledge.append(knowledge)
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Customize the extraction behavior through environment variables:

```bash
# Parallel processing settings
export AGENTIC_DOC_BATCH_SIZE=4
export AGENTIC_DOC_MAX_WORKERS=2

# Retry settings for large documents
export AGENTIC_DOC_MAX_RETRIES=100
export AGENTIC_DOC_MAX_RETRY_WAIT_TIME=60

# Logging style
export AGENTIC_DOC_RETRY_LOGGING_STYLE=log_msg
```
